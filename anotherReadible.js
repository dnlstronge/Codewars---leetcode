/* Your task in order to complete this Kata is to write a function which formats a duration, given as a number of seconds, in a human-friendly way.

The function must accept a non-negative integer. If it is zero, it just returns "now". Otherwise, the duration is expressed as a combination of years, days, hours, minutes and seconds.

It is much easier to understand with an example:

* For seconds = 62, your function should return 
    "1 minute and 2 seconds"
* For seconds = 3662, your function should return
    "1 hour, 1 minute and 2 seconds" */

function formatDuration (seconds) {

  const years = 31536000
  const day = 86400
  const hour = 3600
// years

}


// find years/day/hour/min/ using remainder of? 
// break down and concatenate with a condition if the value is  = 1
